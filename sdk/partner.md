Code samples are designed to help you get started in writing correct code to interface with the Avalara AvaTax APIs. You can do this from a myriad of languages and frameworks and most of them are listed below. You will find officially supported libraries and those that are contributed by our community.

These libraries are open source, and are released as such. If you have located a bug or have questions, please visit the Github repositories that are associated with the sample code and provide feedback there.

<h2>Partner-Maintained Libraries</h2>
